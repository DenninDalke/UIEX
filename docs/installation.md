## Installation

The best method if you are using Unity > 2018.3 is via the new package manager.

* In your unity project root open `Packages/manifest.json`
* Add the following line to the dependencies section `"com.redowl.editor.uiex": "https://github.com/red-owl-games/UIEX.git",`
* Open Unity and the package should download automatically

If you are using Unity < 2018.3 - i'm sorry you are out of luck, UIElements is only useable in this version of unity or higher
