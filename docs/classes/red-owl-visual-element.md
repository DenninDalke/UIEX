This is an abstract base class that derives from `VisualElement` and takes care of all the boiler plate for UIElements - The class is so stupidly simple that i'm going to link it here for you to go read, trust me its really short [so go read it](https://github.com/rocktavious/UIEX/blob/master/Assets/RedOwl/Editor/UIEX/RedOwlVisualElement.cs)

Back? HAHA! Ok so maybe I cheated you a little bit when I said it was simple - all of the functionality is bound up in the [utilities class](https://github.com/rocktavious/UIEX/blob/master/Assets/RedOwl/Editor/UIEX/RedOwlUtils.cs)

But even still its pretty crazy how simple it is.  This code has eliminated a TON of boilerplate from all of my UIElements classes that I no longer want to write UIElements code without this library (and I hope you eventually do too!)
