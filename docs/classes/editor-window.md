# RedOwlEditorWindow
{: .label .label-yellow  }

This class bring together the RedOwlUtils functions into a Unity EditorWindow class that builds its UI using UIElements.  This class is still under heavy development so i won't document it here yet, but it has a few Quailty of Life improvements that make working with editor windows much much easier - go read the code if you want to know more!
