# RedOwlBaseField<T>
{: .label .label-yellow  }

This is an abstract base class that derives from unity's `BaseField<T> which is a VisualElement that works for a specific type.  This class is very similar to RedOwlVisualElement in that all it really does is run the RedOwlUtils.Setup function for you.
