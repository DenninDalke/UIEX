# Key Features

* Reduce boilerplate code when working with UIElementts
* Provide a clean framework for input handleing without writing custom manipulators
* Provide a set of base classes which remove alot of general editor scripting boilerplate
* Act as a library of missing controls from the built in set of controls

#### NOTE: This is a library for coders to help them make unity UI's easier and faster when using UIElements, if you are looking for something a little more friendly i suggest you check out [Odin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041)
